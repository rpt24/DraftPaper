    In this paper, we analyze the performance of DNS over different internet protocols in an effort to compare the performance of the protocols and examine how well the experimental HTTP/3 performs.  Using Google Compute Engine, many virtual machines spanning the globe were instantiated to run our experiment and collect data. In each region offered by Google Compute, there were three virtual machine instances where each had a specific simulated network type. Using multiple vantage points and simulated networks gave depth to the data and comparisons by showing the performance of DNS over specific internet protocols for different locations with a high-grade, mid-grade, and low-grade simulated network connection. HTTP/3 boasts its speed and encryption; however, given the results it may not be the highest performing protocol in terms of time, but the trade-off could be the extra security provided by its encryption.
