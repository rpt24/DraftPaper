\section{Issues and Future Work}
When running the experiment, there were some issues experienced with the Cloudflare DNS resolver.  Cloudflare was used because it was a second server along with Google that supported HTTP/3.  The first issue was Cloudflareâ€™s HTTP/3 support was down temporarily.  This delayed the data collection for the experiment.  The second issue was found when graphing hourly data for DNS-over-HTTP/3 for the Cloudflare server.  The graph displayed a few anomalies in the timing data and it was discovered the timings for these large spikes in time were the timeout for the curl command.  The experiment was run again to test for more anomalies, but none were found the second time.  The reasoning for the timeouts is unknown and could be due to running the experiment shortly after HTTP/3 support came online and it needed further maintenance.  Outside of the Cloudflare issues, the data for DNS-over-HTTP/3 was initially surprising.  It was expected that it would be substantially faster than the other protocols, but that was not the case.  The protocol is still under development and can further be improved on, so while it is not the quickest currently it has potential to be improved upon.
